<h2>Shashank Pathak</h2> 
<p = "aboutme">Hello. I am a mathematics student and I recently completed MS from IISER Bhopal. I am interested in automated theorem proving.
 </p>
<h2> Slides </h2>
<p id="slides">Here you will find all the slides of my seminars (in chronological order).</p>
 
<ul>
<li> This was the presentation that I gave at the end of the first semester of my MS thesis.
 It deals with axiomatizing modal logics of spaces.
 Specifically, the topological interpretation (first given by McKinsey and Tarski) of the basic modal laguage is introduced, and the soundness and completeness result of the modal logic S4 with respect to the class of all topological spaces is described.
 <a href="Seminar 2.pdf"> Topological Completeness of S4</a></li>
 
<li>This is something we (I and my friend Prasanna) presented in the 8th Indian School on Logic and its Applications (ISLA 2020) on the last day as a part of student's presentations.
 In this we describe what is automated theorem proving, and describe the Robbins conjecture whose proof was found by an automated theorem prover EQP.
 <a href="Robbins_no_pause.pdf"> Automated Theorem Proving and the Robbins Conjecture</a></li>
 
<li> This is the presentation of my MS Thesis Defense.
 In this, I describe a recent proof of the McKinsey-Tarski Theorem, and also a model-theoretic proof of the completeness of S4 with respect to the class of all topological spaces. The latter builds a topo-model out of the canonical topological space.
 This is in continuation with the first semester presentation.
